<p> To evaluate resumes and portfolios for designer vacancies, I used some tricks that I learned over time to filter candidates and see in detail some that caught my attention to proceed with scheduling such an initial conversation ... Or rather, the next conversation because the first story was already told. </p>
<p> Currently, it is expected that a portfolio will not be just a collection of final screens about the projects in which it participated. Try to compete for a position by sending something as simple as that and with luck you get an answer "only final screens, no details" at the same time that we are put aside. </p>
<p> Let us be realistic, we lack time for everything. Even to build a portfolio. What, then, will be the best approach to do so? I hear that it is easier when a project is completed and that the details and explanation of the process must be exposed. I keep thinking about the relevance it will have, for those who have to consult dozens of portfolios, how these personas were chosen, how the competition analysis was done or the hexadecimal codes of the main and secondary colors of this or that work. </p>
<p> I prefer to see a portfolio as a short story to be told and that those who read it have a good experience: fluid and simple. In the end, this little story must be the result of a good UX project. It will be sufficiently explanatory of how the candidate solves one of the biggest professional challenges: the possibility to (re) start. </p>
