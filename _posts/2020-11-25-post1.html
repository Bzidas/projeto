<p>After a whole research process and with a lot of information about mobility within the city of Lisbon, I was given the challenge * to, through a very simple technique - crazy eights - explore ideas that could solve two problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>reduce the use of own transport in Lisbon;</li>
  <li>promote the use of more sustainable alternatives for the environment, such as scooters and shared bicycles;</li>
</ol>
<p>These crazy eights are not necessarily demanding to execute nor require great skill for drawing, they are free sketches that allow to explain 8 different ideas or 8 key moments of an idea.</p>
<p>And that's what I designed - the 8 key moments of this app that I would like to have on my phone: 1. an app that groups all the services of the kind and allows the use of any scooter or bicycle shared in the city; 2. through its use, the available equipment (of all brands) and stop stations can be consulted; 3. the daily cost would be unique; 4. possibility of choosing origin, destination and transport preference; 5. Indication of available seats at the stop station; 6. Possibility to reserve nearby equipment; 7. the kms made per day translate into points and profile progression; 8. these points are used to exchange for prizes;</p>
<p>There are many ideas, I hear many times that until they are realized they are nothing. The title is very exaggerated. It is clearly not the best idea ever, but I would say it has legs to walk on so if anyone wants to develop it I can be the first beta tester!</p>
