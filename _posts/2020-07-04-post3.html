<p> A Starbucks coffee is often referred to as a great example of the value that a good experience has: let's think that a coffee bag should be around 10 cents per cup, a spout can still be obtained for 50 cents but a coffee at starbucks it can cost a few euros. If it weren't for COVID, it would be customary to queue up for this & ldquo; experience & rdquo; in which the criterion & ldquo; good coffee & rdquo; it matters very little. </p>
<p> I like coffee and so I easily understand the success of homemade machines. In a simple way you can get a creamy coffee, at the right temperature and with the intensity and flavor you prefer. </p>
<p> But ... Will it always be like this? think of the example of nespresso ... for a simple spout at home we have to carefully plan the purchase of the capsules - which only sell in places of the brand, wait in the usually long line or order online and then the most difficult part ... find out how to connect the machine. The on / off button is not quickly found on each model ... the idea now comes to me that it is a kind of safe and its greatest treasure is coffee. </p>
<p> Interestingly I read in a lesson of the course  Emotional Design - How to Make Products People Will Love  where it is said that a product enhances better emotions when its use is simple (without great conscious effort). At a time when research is so important and people are trying to be anticipated and standardized, will we not come to the conclusion that users just want to feel unique and that the most successful simple products have nothing? </p>
