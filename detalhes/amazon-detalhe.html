    <p>This is a new feature for a platform of our choice - everything it’s possible. 
    Maybe we were inspired by Xmas season. Our goal became to work on the Amazon website and add value to the experience of buying gifts.
    This was a group exercise for the Digital Experience Design postgraduate course.</p>

    <h3>Let’s imagine</h3>
    <p>Anna checks the landing page to know more about this feature.
She sees that it works in 4 steps, seems pretty easy. </p>

    </figure>
    <p>After Anna sets up the Gift Panel with few details, and answer some questions about Elisa - so Amazon can give some gift suggestions - she can choose from those listed or add some more to the gift list.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>A few days later, there is a most voted gift chosen by all the group.
        If everybody agrees Anna gives the order to check out.</p>

            <p>In the checkout process, each one of the members will have the chance to write a personal note.
                Once everyone pays, Anna just needs to confirm everything is ok and the order is shipped.</p>
<p>
Hurray!</p>

    <h3>Some conclusions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This group gift feature is well received by those who hear about it.</li>
        <li>Amazon’s design system is very confusing. It was difficult to maintain consistency.</li>
   </ul>
